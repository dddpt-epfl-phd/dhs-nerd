# Linked HDS github pages website

Hi, this isn't the documentation, it's the linked HDS github pages website, available at https://dddpt-epfl-phd.github.io/dhs-nerd.
(it is placed it in the `docs/` folder as to follow [github pages rules](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-your-github-pages-site))
